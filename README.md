## Requirements
- Multiple types of parking spots for different vehicle types (e.g., car, bike, truck).
- Support for multiple floors.
- Some parking spots have additional features like charging for electric vehicles (EVs).
- Extra features (e.g., charging) incur additional costs.
- Ground floor has multiple entry and exit gates.
- Each gate has a human guard who issues tickets to customers.
- Parking spots are allocated using the "closest available spot" strategy.
- Entry is denied if no parking spots are available.

The design should:
- Follow SOLID principles.
- Apply useful design patterns.
